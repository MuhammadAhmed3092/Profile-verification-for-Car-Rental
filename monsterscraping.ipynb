            "I was honoured to be a guest speaker at the 6th Islamabad Expo, jointly organized by the Islamabad Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IWCCI) and the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI), with support from CARE Pakistan. This event brings together thought leaders, industry experts, policymakers, and innovators to discuss and promote key issues driving social and economic progress for women businesses in Pakistan. The expo took place on September 14th and 15th, 2024, at the Pak-China Friendship Centre in Islamabad. As a panel member, I thoroughly enjoyed the insightful discussions on Financial Inclusion for Women: Digital Solutions and Opportunities. The panel featured a group of intellectual individuals working on women's economic empowerment in Pakistan, who shared valuable ideas and solutions-based approaches. The expo included stalls of various entrepreneurs showcasing unique products from different regions of Pakistan. I met he most talented women from cities across the country, including Karachi, Multan, Peshawar, Quetta, Gilgit, Faisalabad, Abbottabad, Bahawalpur, Hyderabad, and Sargodha. This initiative is invaluable as we firmly believe that women's contributions are essential to the economic prosperity of Pakistan. #IslamabadExpo #IWCCI #ICCI #CAREPakistan #WomenEntrepreneurship #Pakistan #EconomicEmpowerment #SocialProgress #FinancialInclusion #DigitalSolutions #WomenInBusiness #Entrepreneurship #Innovation #Policymakers #ThoughtLeaders #IndustryExperts\n",

They visited to witness the progress of CARE's Success Program, supported by UNICEF. The program's integrated approach to nutrition, WASH, and education has significantly improved the lives of children, adolescents, and women in the region. We showcased the ongoing activities and their remarkable achievements. Mr. Yahya even participated in the nutrition camp, administering nutritional supplements to a malnourished child. It was a meaningful experience to share our work with such esteemed guests.
